      <h1>What is Push vs <em>Pull:</em> ?</h1>
      <p>We know most formal information as "Push", no matter if it's education, political, marketing/advertising or
        otherwise. Others <strong>bombard</strong> us with information, whether we want it or not.</p>
      <p>"Pull" isn't something we have thought much about. That's when <strong>we only get the information we
        seek.</strong> This is mostly an undefined space, so far.</p>
      <p>This site explores what would happen if we seek to engage "Pull" on a more formal basis, especially as far as
        choosing what information we subscribe to.</p>
      <p>This site delivers learning material in smaller chunks, timed on subsequent days, for better absorbtion. You
        might find this most helpful with certain types of information that go into our brains better over a period of
        days and weeks - where we can incorporate them into our routine and muscle memory.</p>
      <p>Are you glazing over when presented with unfamiliar material? <br>Short exposures, repeated days apart and
        varied,
        make it easier to pick up fresh ideas.</p>
      <br>
      <p><em>You</em>, and not others, should be able to select what you pull in to your learning inbox. </p>
