        <h1>Don't be Pushed! <em>Pull:</em></h1>
        <p>Why did we ever allow others to push or broadcast commercial or educational messages into our space without ever being requested? <br> <br>Because, up to now, we never had a choice.<br> This site helps us experiment with alternatives of our own choosing.</p>

        <p>This site delivers learning material in smaller chunks, timed on subsequent days, for better absorbtion. You might find this most helpful with certain types of information that go into our brains better over a period of days and weeks - where we can incorporate them into our routine and muscle memory.</p>
        <p>Are you glazing over when presented with unfamiliar material? <br>Short exposures, repeated days apart and varied,
          make it easier to pick up fresh ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>You</em>, and not others, should be able to select what you pull in to your learning inbox. </p>

        <p>A high tech farmer might think of <strong>PullModel</strong> as drip irrigation - only, for your <strong>mind</strong>.</p>
        <p>You won't find a lot of articles on the web about using Drip Irrigation for the Human Mind. That's too bad,
          because you may find it more pleasant and effective than being shoveled broadcast information that
          we've all become accustomed to.</p>
