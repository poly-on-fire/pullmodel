        <p><strong>Pull</strong> in some drip irrigation - for your <strong>mind</strong>.</p>
        <p>Glazing over when presented with unfamiliar material? <br>Short exposures, repeated days apart and varied,
          make it easier for picking up fresh ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>You</em> pick what you pull in. Other people or organizations have always picked what gets
          <em>pushed</em>.</p>

        <p>You won't find a lot of articles on the web about using Drip Irrigation for the Human Mind. That's too bad,
          because you may find it more pleasant and effective than being pushed around by the broadcast information that
          we've all become accustomed to.</p>
