        <h1>Unsubscribe Me!</h1>
        <p>A PullModel publisher can passively subscribe anyone from his own email list, as he/she is (allegedly) already
        in conversation with that person anyway. PullModel, in this case, is just an extension of his own personal email client.</p>
        <p>If you would like to block such emails, and make him/her stick to personal emails, place your email address in
        the form below and we'll keep you blocked - by him/her, or anybody!.</p>
        <p>We will also let him/her know that you've blocked his messages from PullModel.</p>
